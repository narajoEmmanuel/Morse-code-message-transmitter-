## Project Description
The Morse Code Transmitter project aims to design a digital system capable of transmitting a message in Morse code. 

Morse code is a system that represents letters and numbers using intermittent signals, where dots and dashes represent the duration of the signals. 

The project involves implementing Morse code rules, such as the duration of dots, dashes, and spaces between letters and words.

## Project Implementation Overview
This laboratory project proposes a solution to design a digital circuit that translates alphabet letters and numeric digits into Morse code. The solution employs combinational and sequential logic, utilizing modular design principles to achieve practical understanding and application of hardware description language (HDL). 


## Conclusions
- Design based on combinational and sequential logic successfully translated ASCII characters to Morse code.
- The circuit demonstrated efficient functionality with 1% FPGA usage and 2.192W power consumption.
- Future improvements may focus on enhancing complete message transmission in the FPGA physical circuit.
